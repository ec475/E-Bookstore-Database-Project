## Project Description

This is a Capstone project I completed in the Hyperion Dev Data Science Bootcamp. It is an example of a database program which could be used by a bookstore clerk. It has functionality to add books to the database table, update details of a book in the table, delete a book from the table, and to search for a book by title or author.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
This project was created in Python version 3.10.6. 

Python packages: sqlite3. 

This project should be opened in a software which can open Python files. It was created using Visual Studio Code.

### Installation
This project does not rely on any other files to be installed in its folder.

### Running the program
Running the program will create a menu of options to use the database.
